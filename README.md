# SP24-Envronment-Virtual-Realms-For-Environmental-Stress-Testing
This project was developed using 3D virtual reality technology for CS464 Spring 2024. The project was built using Godot 4.2.2 and utilizing the XRTools library. Upon entering into the program, the user can organize various objects that are scattered around the scene. Upon completing organization for each scene, the user will be entered into the next scene.

## Hardware Requirements
To run the project successfully, a headset must be connected to a Windows machine, and that headset must support the OpenXR standard. Testing and development was done utilizing a Meta Quest 2.

## Setup
1. Install Godot 4.2.2
2. Import the repository into Godot
3. Click the play button on the top right to start the program
